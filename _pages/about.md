Hello World! I am Mayank, a PhD student at the University of Arizona. I work on Natural Language Processing under the supervision of [Prof. Eduardo Blanco](https://eduardoblanco.github.io/). My current research focuses on the automatic discovery of high-performing Multi-Agent Systems for a range of tasks. I am also interested in reasoning models. I'm an experienced Software/Machine Learning Engineer having worked in the tech industry for around 8 years. Having always been keen on AI research, I finally decided to dedicate myself fully to this field and pursue a PhD. I completed my Masters and Bachelors at the [New York University (CIMS)](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and the [BITS Pilani - Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), respectively. I'm always open to any collaborations. So, feel free to reach out if you like my work!
