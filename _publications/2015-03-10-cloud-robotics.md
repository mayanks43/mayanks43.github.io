excerpt: 'This paper presents an architecture, protocol, and parallel algorithms for collaborative 3D mapping in the cloud with low-cost robots. The robots run a dense visual odometry algorithm on a smartphone-class processor. Key-frames from the visual odometry are sent to the cloud for parallel optimization and merging with maps produced by other robots. After optimization the cloud pushes the updated poses of the local key-frames back to the robots. All processes are managed by Rapyuta, a cloud robotics framework that runs in a commercial data center. This paper includes qualitative visualization of collaboratively built maps, as well as quantitative evaluation of localization accuracy, bandwidth usage, processing speeds, and map storage.'
